# Discovery and Communication Between Microservices

**Ways of Synchronous Communication**

   - RestTemplate + application.properties
   - RestTemplate + config server
   - Aspect Oriented Communication
   - Feign Client

**Registry, Discovery and Load Balancing**

  - Service Registry and Discovery
  - Eureka
  - API Gateway
  - Load Balancing

  **Service Registry:** As the number of microservices increases, it becomes a challenge to keep track of the updated addresses of all of the microservices within all the other microservices. To overcome this challenge, a service registry is used to store the updated addresses of these microservices. Any microservices in the application self-registers on the registry.

  **Service Discovery:** When a microservice wishes to communicate with another microservice, it requires the service address, which can be retrieved from the registry.
It serves as a common location for any microservice to find the updated address of another microservice.

  **Netflix Eureka:** It is a service registry and discovery solution provided by Netflix. It consists of the Eureka Server and Eureka clients. Eureka Server is a microservice by itself, to which all the other microservices registers. Eureka clients are independent microservices in a microservice architecture.
  
  **API Gateway:** It is a gateway for the incoming client request in an application. It is an API management tool that sits between the client application and a collection of back-end services. The API gateway handles all the client requests that come through the application. Once the request reaches the API gateway, it is appropriately routed to the relevant microservice.
  
  **Load Balancing:** It is the efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers or microservice instances. A load balancer sits between the client devices and the back-end services. It receives and distributes the incoming client requests to any available instance that is capable of fulfilling them.

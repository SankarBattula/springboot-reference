# Discovery and Communication Between Microservices

Two main types of communication happen between microservices:

   1. Synchronous Communication:
  
      - In this method, the calling service waits for a response from the called service. The calling thread of the service gets blocked unless a response is received.         This is also called a blocking mechanism. In this method, the communication occurs in real time.
      - It takes place between two microservices and is a one-on-one interaction.
      
   2. Asynchronous Communication:
   
      - In this method, the calling service does not wait for a response and continues to execute the code. A late response or an acknowledgment may be received in             this case. Since the calling thread is not blocked for further processing, this is a non-blocking mechanism.
      - The interaction can be one-on-one or one-to-many.
      - The following are two ways of establishing asynchronous
      
      communication:
      
         ○ Messaging
         ○ Event-driven communication
   
**Ways of Synchronous Communication**

   - RestTemplate + application.properties
   - RestTemplate + config server
   - Aspect Oriented Communication
   - Feign Client

   Some of the important components of Kafka include the following:
   - **Topics**: Topics are organised collections of data that are used for storing messages.
   - **Partitions**: Topics are further divided into partitions in order to increase parallelism.
   - **Producers**: Producers are responsible for writing messages to partitions. Messages sent by producers contain a key and a value.
   - **Consumers**: Consumers subscribe to topics and read messages from them. Messages are read in the order in which they are pushed.
   - **Consumer groups**: Consumers can be grouped together to form consumer groups. Resources are utilised optimally when the number of consumers in a group equals the number of partitions of a topic.
   - **Brokers**: Brokers are responsible for storing data and making it available to consumers
   - **Kafka cluster**: A Kafka cluster is a group of one or more brokers running Kafka.
   - **Zookeeper**: The zookeeper is responsible for coordinating between brokers in a cluster. You cannot use Kafka without the zookeeper.

   **Sending Messages** : Kafka Producer API
      Kafka producer API helps to deliver messages directly to brokers that are the leader of the partitions without any routing tier. It sends streams of data to topics in the cluster. Producer API uses Kafka producer to instantiate the producer instance that would help in sending messages. Key properties required to configure include bootstrap.servers, key.serializers and value.serializer.
      
   **Receiving Messages** : Kafka Consumer
     The Kafka consumer fetches request to get data from brokers leading the partition. It specifies the offset log from where it wants to receive the data in the partition. Consumers can be part of consumer groups or single entities. Based on the number of consumers in the consumer group, each consumer is assigned a particular partition. The consumer uses a pull data mechanism to fetch data. The consumer API reads a stream of data from the topics in the Kafka cluster. To use the consumer API, you can use the following dependency which is the same as the producer API.
      
   **Consumer API**: subscribe()
     The Kafka consumer API is used to subscribe to a specific topic. The values passed to the subscribe method is a list of string formats. All the messages are pulled from all the partitions of the topic using this method. You can put multiple topic names to subscribe to multiple topics from the same consumer.
      
   **Consumer API**: assign()
     The assign API is used to subscribe to single partitions of a topic. You can subscribe to multiple partitions of the topic as well. The assign API is useful when you want to load balance your consumption.

**Registry, Discovery and Load Balancing**

  - Service Registry and Discovery
  - Eureka
  - API Gateway
  - Load Balancing 

  **Service Registry:** As the number of microservices increases, it becomes a challenge to keep track of the updated addresses of all of the microservices within all the other microservices. To overcome this challenge, a service registry is used to store the updated addresses of these microservices. Any microservices in the application self-registers on the registry.

  **Service Discovery:** When a microservice wishes to communicate with another microservice, it requires the service address, which can be retrieved from the registry.
It serves as a common location for any microservice to find the updated address of another microservice.

  **Netflix Eureka:** It is a service registry and discovery solution provided by Netflix. It consists of the Eureka Server and Eureka clients. Eureka Server is a microservice by itself, to which all the other microservices registers. Eureka clients are independent microservices in a microservice architecture.

  **API Gateway:** It is a gateway for the incoming client request in an application. It is an API management tool that sits between the client application and a collection of back-end services. The API gateway handles all the client requests that come through the application. Once the request reaches the API gateway, it is appropriately routed to the relevant microservice.

  **Load Balancing:** It is the efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers or microservice instances. A load balancer sits between the client devices and the back-end services. It receives and distributes the incoming client requests to any available instance that is capable of fulfilling them.

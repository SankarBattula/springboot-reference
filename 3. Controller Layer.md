# Controller Layer 

- The controller layer exposes the backend of the web application on the basis of the type of request and the business logic. The controller class handles the clientsâ€™ requests and sends back appropriate responses. 

- The **@RestController** annotation is a more recent annotation that can be used to declare controller class and provides an easier implementation than the @Controller annotation.

- Inside the controller class, different methods are mapped to the URI using the **@RequestMapping** annotation. The value attribute of @RequestMappings specifies the URI to be mapped and the method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be mapped. **@RequestMapping** can be implemented at both class level and method level, which enables you to create flexible REST endpoints. 

- @RequestMapping can be replaced with **@GetMapping**, **@PostMapping**, **@PutMapping** and **@DeleteMapping**. These annotations do not have method attributes, since their name itself suggests the type of method they implement. 

- Multiple URIs can also be mapped using the value attribute of **@RequestMapping**. This value attribute accepts an array of URIs that can be mapped to methods/a class. However, the implementation of multi URI mapping is not generally recommended.

- APIs are used to extend your business logic to other organisations to use the existing services. APIs allow the applications to interact with each other irrespective of their source language. AuthKeys and AuthTokens are used to control the accessibility of APIs.

- CRUD operations are handled inside the controller class. These CRUD operations enable the APIs to operate on the database. The value attributes of the RequestMapping annotation are used to map various HTTP methods. Alternatively, you can directly use @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping and @DeleteMapping annotations.

- Microservices need to call APIs programmatically. These calls are handled in either of two ways: **synchronously** and **asynchronously**. In synchronous call handling, the thread is blocked until a server response is received. On the contrary, in asynchronous call handling, the thread is free and follows an event-based mechanism. 

- **Asynchronous call handling enhances the resource of the application**, which improves its overall performance. The approach of synchronous call handling is used for the processes in which the order of events is important, such as during the processing of any payment. Whereas, the asynchronous call handling is preferred for the processes in which the sequence of events is not important, such as while sending an OTP. 

- RestTemplate handles the calls synchronously. **@RestTemplate**  annotation is old but is still supported by Spring. On the other hand, **WebClient** is a more recent method that allows asynchronous handling of the calls. The developers also have the option to use .block() functionality to make the WebClient behave like RestTemplate.

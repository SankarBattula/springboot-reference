# AOP, Exception Handling and Application Security

**Aspect-Oriented Programming**

- Cross-cutting concerns are those concerns that affect the entire application. These concerns are needed in almost every part of the application. Some of the examples of cross-cutting concerns are **logging, security, data transfer, transaction handling**, etc.

- Some of the advantages of AOP include modularisation of cross-cutting concerns, easy maintainability of the code efficient development process, reusability of the code which leads to less code being written.

- AOP is another programming paradigm where the programming logic is organised into different parts to handle the cross-cutting concerns separately. **It decouples the cross-cutting concerns from the actual business logic** of the application and can be clubbed with any other programming paradigm.

- Different types of advice in AOP are as follows:

  1. **Before advice**: Advice that executes before a join point

  2. **After returning advice**: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally, for example, a method returns without throwing an exception

  3. **After throwing advice**: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception

  4. **After (finally) advice**: Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits

  5. **Around advice**: Advice that surrounds a join point such as method invocation. This is the most powerful kind of advice

# AOP, Exception Handling and Application Security

$\color{red}{Aspect-Oriented Programming}$

- Cross-cutting concerns are those concerns that affect the entire application. These concerns are needed in almost every part of the application. Some of the examples of cross-cutting concerns are **logging, security, data transfer, transaction handling**, etc.

- Some of the advantages of AOP include modularisation of cross-cutting concerns, easy maintainability of the code efficient development process, reusability of the code which leads to less code being written.

- AOP is another programming paradigm where the programming logic is organised into different parts to handle the cross-cutting concerns separately. **It decouples the cross-cutting concerns from the actual business logic** of the application and can be clubbed with any other programming paradigm.

- Different types of advice in AOP are as follows:

  1. **Before advice**: Advice that executes before a join point

  2. **After returning advice**: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally, for example, a method returns without throwing an exception

  3. **After throwing advice**: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception

  4. **After (finally) advice**: Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits

  5. **Around advice**: Advice that surrounds a join point such as method invocation. This is the most powerful kind of advice

$\color{red}{Validation and Exception Handling}$

- It is important to validate the request that is being sent by the client so that you only accept requests that are valid or in the desired format.

- Some of the advantages of performing validations are as follows:

  1. Helps to improve performance, as the resources are being utilised only on the valid requests
  2. Prevents wastage of resources, as these resources are not spent on any invalid request that the client has sent
  3. Helps you to avoid injection attacks and properly handle SQL injection attacks that might lead to data loss or data theft
  
- Validations can be performed at the frontend and the backend. Validation for critical and sensitive data should be avoided at the frontend layer, as it might expose your business logic.

- You can use the Hibernate validator to perform validation in your project. You can use different annotations to perform validation. You can also perform custom validation by creating user-defined constraints that are not present in the validation library that you are using.

- An exception is any unexpected behaviour that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions can occur owing to multiple scenarios, and when these happen, they need to be handled properly. 

- If exceptions are not handled properly, it might expose the sensitive information of your application to hackers, and they can take undue advantage of this. Also, in many cases, they need to be handled properly, and proper responses need to be shown to clients. 

- Properly handling exceptions makes your application more user friendly and also provides security, as you are not exposing sensitive information that is related to your application.

$\color{red}{Application Security}$

- Security is important because of the following reasons:
  1. Critical and sensitive information of the user needs to be secured.
  2. Defence or military applications, as well as patented stuff, also need to be secured.
  
- Authentication is the process of checking or verifying someone’s identity. An authorisation is a process of permitting a particular authenticated user to make use of some functions or providing some leverages based on the user’s details. 

- You can perform authentication in different ways. Some of them are listed below:
    1. Password-based authentication
    2. Multi-factor authentication
    3. Certificate-based authentication
    4. Biometric authentication
    5. Token-based authentication
    
- In **password-based authentication**, a username and password are required to log in. The challenge here is that passwords are prone to phishing attacks and people also use the same passwords for multiple websites, which makes this type of authentication less effective and not sufficient to protect online sites.

- In **multi-factor authentication**, two or more independent ways are required to authenticate a user. These multiple layers of security provide a good defence against most hacks.

- In **certificate-based authentication**, users are identified using digital certificates. 

- **Biometric authentication** depends on the biological characteristics of a user.

- In **token-based authentication**, the user enters their credentials once and receives a unique encrypted string of characters in headers called a token. Once they have received this token, there is no need to provide credentials with every request.

- There are three parts of a JWT Token. These are header, payload and signature. The header part contains the algorithm and the type of the token. The payload part contains the actual data. The signature part contains a hash of the encoded header and payload along with a secret.

- JWT is a token format, whereas OAuth is an authorisation protocol.

- Filters intercept the incoming HTTP requests and responses and change the behaviour.

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/ enables cross-origin requests for a RESTful web service.
